# RoomModeling

A browser-based 3D room editor built with Three.js.
Users can design a room, place furniture and assets, inspect and transform objects, and save/load scenes — all in real time.

This project is implemented using vanilla JavaScript + ES modules, with no build step required.

Still a work in progress.
